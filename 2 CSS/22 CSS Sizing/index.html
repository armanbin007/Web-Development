        Hi there, I am Iron Man. Tony Stark made his entry as Iron Man in his 1st franchise because he wanted to make a
        statement........
    </div>
    <div style="color: bisque; background-color: black;">
        <h1>Anthony Edward Stark (Iron Man)</h1>

        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>Anthony Edward Stark (Tony) was born on May 29, 1970, in Manhattan, New York to Howard Stark, a famous genius
            inventor and businessman, and Maria Stark, a socialite and philanthropist. Growing up under the eye of
            family
            butler Edwin Jarvis, his life was characterized by a cold and affectionless relationship with his father.
            Seeing
            that his son could achieve great things, Howard tried to inspire him with constant talks about his own role
            in the
            creation of Captain America. This instead embittered Stark, who felt that his father was taking more pride
            in his creations than in his family. A brilliant and unique child prodigy, Stark attended the prestigious
            Phillips Academy in Andover before entering MIT at age 14 and graduating summa cum laude at 17.</p>

        <h2>Inheritance and Rise</h2>
        <p>On December 16, 1991, when Stark was 21, his parents went away to the Bahamas, but planned to stop at the
            Pentagon to deliver Super Soldier Serum Howard had redeveloped. Instead, both are killed in a car
            accidentâ€”later
            revealed to be an assassination carried out by the Winter Soldier, who was mind-controlled by Hydra. As a
            result,
            Stark inherited his father's company, becoming CEO of Stark Industries. Over the years, he became well known
            as a
            weapons designer and inventor, and lived a playboy lifestyle.</p>

        <h2>Becoming Iron Man</h2>
        <p>In 2010, Stark travels to war-torn Afghanistan with his friend and military liaison Lieutenant Colonel James
            Rhodes to demonstrate Stark's new "Jericho" missile. After the demonstration, the convoy is ambushed and
            Stark
            is critically wounded and imprisoned by a terrorist group, the Ten Rings. Fellow captive Ho Yinsen implants
            an
            electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep shrapnel from reaching his heart. Together they build the first
            arc reactor and prototype Iron Man suit to escape. Upon returning home, Stark announces Stark Industries
            will
            no longer manufacture weapons and begins developing advanced Iron Man suits.</p>

        <h2>Major Battles and Adventures</h2>
        <p>Stark faces numerous battles including against Obadiah Stane, Ivan Vanko (Whiplash), Aldrich Killian,
            and later joins the Avengers to fight Loki in the Battle of New York. He continues improving his suits,
            battling PTSD, creating Ultron, and ultimately becoming a key member of the Avengers Initiative.</p>

        <h2>Infinity War and Sacrifice</h2>
        <p>Stark plays a critical role in the fight against Thanos, traveling to Titan with Spider-Man and Doctor
            Strange, and later executing the "Time Heist" with the Avengers. In 2023, he sacrifices his life using
            the Infinity Stones to eliminate Thanos and save the universe. His legacy continues through the Avengers
            and his mentorship of Peter Parker (Spider-Man).</p>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>Tony Stark is remembered as a hero, genius, and philanthropist who saved the universe at the cost of his own
            life, proving that even a man in a suit of armor could have a heart.</p>
